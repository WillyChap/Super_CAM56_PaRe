# SuperModel


# to run: 


FIRST RUN

- **$ source ./setup.sh**

THEN a few python files should be written in the home directory. 

Change the settings in "init_supermodel.py" and run this file (***$ ./init_supermodel.py***)

This will create python files and you will run:

- ***$ ./buildmodels.py***

This will create two model instances of CAM5 and CAM6 that have the names you specified in the **setup.sh** script.
